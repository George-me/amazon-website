      "First a disclaimer, I am not the typical demographic for noise cancelling headphones, I wanted this proudct mostly for office use and I dont listen much to music. However, I listen to podcasts and the headphone definitely come handy in such situations. Overall my impressions of using the headphone over the last 2 weeks are summarized below Fit The fit is comfortable, but I sometime feel the buds are not secured in my ear and may fall out, only to check with my hands and then realize its secure in the ear. I am a runner, and I will definitely be trying out the performance when running.",

      "The developers of this product just hate people. This thing has 0 buttons. There are also 0 instructions included in the box. They literally just tell you to install the app to manage literally anything, even pairing, from there. I don‚Äôt want to install another app on my phone! I had to spend 30 minutes of my life googling for any controls to this thing. Not having a clear ‚Äúpair‚Äù button or instruction is a crime. Super frustrated with this purchase Sound is ok, fit is a bit weird.",

      "The earbuds charging case is very cheap plastic and cheap sound when closing the lid. I was expecting a better sound quality from bose, as everyone is hyping about it, but sound quality is mediocre.",

      "Bose introduces the QuietComfort Earbuds a wallet friendly option from a company known for making premier sound products. These earbuds pack a punch with their design, sound, and noise canceling capabilities. My favorite part of these earbuds is the fit. With multiple ear tips and wingtips sizes along with their lightweight design these earbuds are super comfortable and fit great. This leads into the next great point, they support a 8.5 hour battery life with ANC along with wireless charging. You can truly wear these all day because of how comfortable they are and how long the battery lasts. ANC on this product is amazing but my favorite way to wear them is in Aware mode. The new Bose app is super easy to use and provides the user with multiple customizations offers. Bose really created an excellent product which I would recommend to all my friends.",
